Communication use cases include: \r\n- A reminder or alert delivered to a responsible provider \r\n\r\n- A recorded notification from a nurse to the on-call physician (or any other specified person) that a patient's temperature exceeds a value \r\n\r\n- A notification to a public health agency of a patient presenting with a communicable disease reportable to the public health agency \r\n\r\n- Educational material sent by a provider to an individual \r\n\r\n- Unable to deliver laboratory results to the appropriate care practitioners","copyright":"Copyright © 2020 HL7 UK Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
